# SongZinn
Android App and python script for automated downloading of Hindi songs

<a href='https://github.com/abhimanyuZ/SongZinn/blob/master/songs.py'>songs.py</a> contains code for scraping a website to facilitate downloading of Bollywood songs.
Benifit of downloading songs this way is avoiding clickjacking and irritating advertisements.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/abhimanyuZ/SongZinn/blob/master/music.mp3">music.mp3</a> is just a small audio clip to notify users when download is done.
<br>

<a href="https://github.com/abhimanyuZ/SongZinn/blob/master/Beatz.zip">Beatz.zip</a> contains the code for an android app which serves the same purpose as the songs.py app. 
In addition to that it provides a neat UI for android users.

NOTE: It's just for educational purposes. Neither do I promote scraping websites to avoid advertisements nor do I promote downloading songs in this way.
